# Svelte Puzzle Sandbox

Building interactive puzzles with Svelte!

## Getting Started

Requires:

- Node 10.19.0, managed by [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
- [Yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

Running Locally:

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
1. Start local server: `npm run dev`
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/`. That's it!

Misc:

I use VS Code, so this project includes recommended extensions!

## Goals

- Want to try something new to refresh from day to day.
- Dreaming of making a web room escape like game for fun!
